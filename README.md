# Face Recognition App

This project was created as part of my studies following a Udemy course when learning React.

A user enters a URL to an image and the app will detect faces in the image and draw rectangles around them.

This app connects to an API that processes the image and returns co-ordinates.

This was a fun project to work on, and gave me a better understanding of React, State management, NodeJS and API calls.
